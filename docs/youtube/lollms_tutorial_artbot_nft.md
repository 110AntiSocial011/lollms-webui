Before we dive into the exciting world of artbot, let's take a moment to understand the terms of use. Artbot is an incredible AI-powered tool that utilizes an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate positive and negative prompts, which are then fed to an image generation model. Additionally, artbot has the ability to view your images and convert them into text descriptions using Blip, allowing the LLM to comprehend them better. What's fascinating is that artbot can also engage in conversations with you, enabling you to build upon vague ideas and transform them into something truly beautiful and original.
Now, it's essential to be transparent about the collaborative nature of working with AI. When presenting your artwork created with artbot, it's crucial to explicitly acknowledge the collaboration with AI and not claim it as your own manual production. The purpose of these tools is to inspire and assist you in thinking creatively, ultimately enhancing your artistic abilities. Transparency is key, as flooding the world with AI-generated content can lead to unfair competition with individuals who dedicate time and care to manual work. Manual work should be valued and appreciated in its own right.
Therefore, let's be honest and focus on valuing the ideas behind the artwork. When someone purchases your NFT, they should be aware that it is AI-generated, and the added value comes from your initiative and collaboration with artbot. By doing so, we ensure that the true worth of manual work is recognized, and the creative potential of AI is utilized responsibly.
Now that we've set the stage, let's unleash our imagination and embark on an artistic journey with artbot. Get ready to witness the incredible possibilities and showcase your unique artistic vision to the world through NFTs on opensea!
