Hi there, fellow creators! Today, I have something incredibly exciting to share with you. Get ready to unleash your artistic side and dive into the world of artbot. In this video, I'll guide you through the process of creating mesmerizing and unique art using the artbot persona of lollmz, an incredible tool that will ignite your creativity.

But wait, there's more! We won't stop at just creating art. We'll take it a step further and explore the world of NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Now, I know what you're thinking, 'NFTs? That sounds complicated!' Don't worry, I've got your back. We'll focus primarily on the art generation aspect using artbot, as the process of making NFTs has already been covered extensively in other videos.

By the end of this video, you'll have a stunning collection of art pieces ready to be shared with the world. And guess what? We won't just keep it to ourselves. We'll take our art to the next level by posting it to opensea, a popular platform on the Ethereum blockchain dedicated to showcasing and trading NFTs.

But here's the exciting part - our art collection will be available for a limited period of time. So, make sure you stick around till the end to witness the grand drop on opensea. Trust me, you won't want to miss this!

So, whether you're an aspiring artist or a seasoned creator looking to explore the world of NFTs, this video is for you. Get ready to create, captivate, and conquer the art world with artbot and opensea. Let's make your artistic dreams a reality!


Before we dive into the exciting world of artbot, let's take a moment to understand the terms of use. Artbot is an incredible AI-powered tool that utilizes an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate positive and negative prompts, which are then fed to an image generation model. Additionally, artbot has the ability to view your images and convert them into text descriptions using Blip, allowing the LLM to comprehend them better. What's fascinating is that artbot can also engage in conversations with you, enabling you to build upon vague ideas and transform them into something truly beautiful and original.
Now, it's essential to be transparent about the collaborative nature of working with AI. When presenting your artwork created with artbot, it's crucial to explicitly acknowledge the collaboration with AI and not claim it as your own manual production. The purpose of these tools is to inspire and assist you in thinking creatively, ultimately enhancing your artistic abilities. Transparency is key, as flooding the world with AI-generated content can lead to unfair competition with individuals who dedicate time and care to manual work. Manual work should be valued and appreciated in its own right.
Therefore, let's be honest and focus on valuing the ideas behind the artwork. When someone purchases your NFT, they should be aware that it is AI-generated, and the added value comes from your initiative and collaboration with artbot. By doing so, we ensure that the true worth of manual work is recognized, and the creative potential of AI is utilized responsibly.
Now that we've set the stage, let's unleash our imagination and embark on an artistic journey with artbot. Get ready to witness the incredible possibilities and showcase your unique artistic vision to the world through NFTs on opensea!








To start,we assume you have already installed lollmz. If not, please refer to the previous video on my channel. In this video, we will show you how to use Artbot v2.0 on lollmz v6.7. Upgrades are constantly being added to the tool, so new features may come over time.

To begin, let's go to the settings tab. Under the personalities section, select the category "Art". Now you can find Artbot. To mount it, simply press the menu and select "Mount". Great! Artbot is now mounted and selected. Let's head back to the discussions tab and press the "+" button to start a new discussion.

First, let's take a look at the configurations that we can modify on this personality. To show the configuration page, just press the personality icon. As you can see, there are many configurations here. For example, you can choose the type of images to generate, ranging from artworks to photos and even game assets and icons.

Next, we can select the engine. Up until this version, we support stable diffusion via the modified version of automatic1111's tool. We also support Dali2 via the OpenAI API. Please note that if you want to use Dali2, you will need to supply an OpenAI key.

But that's not all! We have many other configurations available. For instance, you can activate or deactivate AI imagination block controlled by the active LLM model. You can also activate or deactivate the image generation, which can come in handy if you only want to generate the prompt and perform the generation using the stable diffusion web UI for tasks like inpainting or other complex operations. Additionally, you can use Midjourney or Dali3 (which we will support natively as soon as they release their API). There are also options to control the resolution, scaling, number of images to generate, and sampler.

With these configurations, you have the power to customize your art generation experience and create truly unique and mesmerizing pieces. So what are you waiting for? Let your imagination run wild and let Artbot bring your artistic visions to life!

In the next part of the video, we will learn how to generate an image using Artbot without utilizing the imagination module. To begin, simply deactivate the "imagine" option and enter your prompt. The system expects one or two lines of text. If you provide only one line, it will be considered as the positive prompt. If you provide a second line, it will be considered as the negative prompt, and the generation model will try to avoid its content.

In this example, we will test a simple prompt with a positive prompt and my recipe negative prompt. Once you press enter, the system will start generating the images. We will generate six images, so please wait for them to be built. Once they are ready, you can select the image you like the most and save it.

Here we're going to make some Steampunk style artworks. As you can see, the artworks are good as we did use the default negative prompt which enhances the generated images. It is important to learn how to prompt the AI in this imaginationless mode as you are the one who needs to do the imagination and the prompting.

Now let's try to test a steampunk illustration in continuous mode. To activate this mode, just go to the settings of artbot and select continue_from_last_image. This means that the prompts will induce updates to last picture instead of starting from scratch. We can also fix the image to image denoising strength. A bigger value yields more changes to the generated image, and a smaller value yields less changes.
